# Source code
The current development version of LXC can be cloned from Github with:

    git clone git://github.com/lxc/lxc

Source tarballs from the various stable releases are also available in
the [downloads](/lxc/downloads) section.

Patches sent upstream for review must be based on the current git tree  
and not on stable releases, unless the bug only affects a stable release.

# Patch submission process
You may contribute to LXC either by sending a patch or patchset directly
on the [lxc-devel mailing-list](https://lists.linuxcontainers.org/listinfo/lxc-devel).
