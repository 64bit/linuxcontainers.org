# The early days
LXD is still under very active development and the OpenStack Nova plugin isn't usable just yet.

To get an early feel of regular LXC in OpenStack, Ubuntu users can try the "nova-compute-flex"  
package which provides native LXC within OpenStack and will be replaced by "nova-compute-lxd"  
in the next Ubuntu release.
