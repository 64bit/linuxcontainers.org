# Distribution packages
Currently only Ubuntu includes lxd and that's only in the current development release.  
We expect it to be soon picked up by the other distributions who already ship recent LXC today.

For Ubuntu users, there's also a daily PPA for LXD:

 * [lxd-daily](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-lxc/+archive/lxd-daily): Daily builds of the LXD master branch

# Current development version

You can clone lxd directly with:

    git clone git://github.com/lxc/lxd

# Release tarballs

Stable release tarballs are available for download below.
