## LXD 0.2 release announcement<span class="text-muted">27th of February 2015</span>

The major changes for this release are:

 * Initial version of the built-in image store
   * All containers must now be created from images
   * Images can be imported into LXD by using the provided "lxd-images" tool
   * Image aliases can be setup to make it easier to find your images
 * Database backend (all LXD data is now stored in a SQLite database)
 * Early stage of container configuration (partial API only)
 * Support for building for many architectures through gcc-go (not all dependencies are compatible)
 * Reworked exec mechanism
 * A lot of bugfixes

Please note that it's still early in the LXD development and that current LXD isn't intended  
for production use and comes with no support statement from upstream.  
(reported bugs and patches will be included in the next release)

We are still busy working on container migration, proper container configuration and a stable REST API.

## LXD 0.1 release announcement<span class="text-muted">13th of February 2015</span>
This is the initial LXD release.

With this first release of LXD, it is possible to:

 * List containers
 * create, destroy, start, stop and execute commands into an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS amd64 container
 * Transfer files in and out of containers
 * Management of multiple LXD hosts through the lxc command line tool
 * Experiment with the LXD [REST API](/lxd/rest-api)

Support for other container images, container migration, container configuration and profiles  
and a stable REST API will be coming in the next few releases.

This release is our first development snapshot and isn't intended for production use  
and comes with no support statement from upstream.
