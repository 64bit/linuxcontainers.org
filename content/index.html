       linuxcontainers.org is the umbrella project behind LXC,
       LXD and CGManager.</p>

    <p>The goal is to offer a distro and vendor neutral environment
       for the development of Linux container technologies.
       The project provides resources such as build machines, CI
       infrastructure, mailing-lists, website, e-mail, ...
       to the various projects under it.</p>

    <p>Current project sponsors are:
        <ul>

        <h3>LXC <span class="text-muted">(lex-cee)</span></h3>
        <p>LXC is the well known set of tools, templates,
           library and language bindings. It's pretty low
           level, very flexible and covers just about every
           containment feature supported by the upstream
           kernel.</p>
        <p>LXC is production ready with LXC 1.0 getting 5
           years of security updates and bugfixes
           (until April 2019).</p>

        <h3>LXD <span class="text-muted">(lex-dee)</span></h3>
        <p>LXD is the new LXC experience. It offers a
           completely fresh and intuitive user experience
           with a single command line tool to manage your
           containers. Containers can be managed over the
           network in a transparent way through a REST API.
           It also works with large scale deployments by
           integrating with OpenStack.</p>

        <p>LXD was announced in early November 2014 and is
           still under very active development.</p>

        <h3>CGManager</h3>
        <p>CGManager is our cgroup manager daemon. It's
           designed to allow nested unprivileged containers
           to still be able to create and manage their
           cgroups through a DBus API.</p>

        <p>CGManager has been used by default with LXC in
           Ubuntu since April 2014 and since by other
           distributions as they start needing working
           unprivileged containers.</p>
