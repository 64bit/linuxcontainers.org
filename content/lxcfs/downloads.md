# Distribution packages
Currently only Ubuntu includes lxcfs and that's only in the current development release.  
We expect it to be soon picked up by the other distributions who already ship cgmanager today.

For Ubuntu users, the official LXC PPAs also contain up to date versions of lxcfs:

 * [daily](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-lxc/+archive/daily): Daily builds of the LXC master branch

# Current development version

You can clone lxcfs directly with:

    git clone git://github.com/lxc/lxcfs

# Release tarballs

Stable release tarballs are available for download below.
