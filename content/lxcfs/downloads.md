# Distribution packages
Currently only Ubuntu includes lxcfs and that's only in the current development release.  
We expect it to be soon picked up by the other distributions who already ship cgmanager today.

For Ubuntu users, we have an official PPA for LXCFS:

 * [lxcfs-stable](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-lxc/+archive/lxcfs-stable): Latest stable release

And for those who want development snapshots:

 * [lxcfs-git-master](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-lxc/+archive/lxcfs-git-master): "master" branch

# Current development version

You can clone lxcfs directly with:

    git clone git://github.com/lxc/lxcfs

# Release tarballs

Stable release tarballs are available for download below.
