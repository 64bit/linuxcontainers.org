Packager-friendly release of LXCFS 0.2.

This release now installs /usr/share/lxcfs/lxc.mount.hook and /usr/share/lxc/common.conf.d/00-lxcfs.conf  
which when combined with LXC 1.1 will automatically enable lxcfs for all containers.

Additionally this release also includes some fixes to the testsuite.

## LXCFS 0.1 release announcement<span class="text-muted">9th of January 2015</span>
This is the initial LXCFS release.

It offers a basic cgroupfs-like interface which writes through CGManager as well as  
cgroup-ified versions of the cpuinfo, meminfo, stat and uptime proc files.


Note that as the first release of LXCFS, things can still be very rough and we would advice  
against using this in production.
