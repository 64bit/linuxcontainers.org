## LXCFS 0.1 release announcement<span class="text-muted">9th of January 2015</span>
This is the initial LXCFS release.

It offers a basic cgroupfs-like interface which writes through CGManager as well as  
cgroup-ified versions of the cpuinfo, meminfo, stat and uptime proc files.


Note that as the first release of LXCFS, things can still be very rough and we would advice  
against using this in production.

### Downloads
The release tarballs can be found on our [download page](/lxcfs/downloads).
