# Distribution packages
At this time, both Ubuntu and Debian provide cgmanager packages.  
On those, CGManager will typically come as a dependency of LXC or even be installed by default.  
If not, just install it using your package manager.

For Ubuntu users, the official LXC PPAs also contain up to date versions of CGManager:

 * [stable](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-lxc/+archive/stable): Backports of the current stable release of LXC
 * [daily-stable](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-lxc/+archive/daily-stable): Daily builds of the LXC stable-1.0 branch
 * [daily](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-lxc/+archive/daily): Daily builds of the LXC master branch

# Current development version
